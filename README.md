# Heretic's Perl

Perl files for editing all these demons  
Both JP and ENG versions are kept in case needed with other files (skills file)  
Fusion translation possibly needs access to the translated version; we shall see  
  
Also please remember:
>git add (stuff)  
>git comit -m "message"  
>git push -u origin master (or just git push)
