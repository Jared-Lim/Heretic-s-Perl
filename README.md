# Heretic's Perl

Perl files for editing all these demons  
Both JP and ENG versions are kept in case needed with other files (skills file)  
Fusion translation possibly needs access to the translated version; we shall see  
  
Based on the results in variable.txt,  
there are these variables in Demons:  
>tribe
>nameJP
>nameEN
>level
>stats
>affinity
>skills
>fusions
>mutate (alternates between fusion depends on demon)
>dlc (only on one demon, dont use)
>notes (also on very few demons why)
>profile (only on demons with notes, is demon description also hard to translate)
